                                        Peckish Extra Goodness energy suet fat balls for wild birds contain a nutritious blend of seeds and suet that will attract a wide variety of wild birds to your garden. It's ideal to feed these suet balls from an fat ball feeder and feed garden birds all year round. Once you have started to feed the birds, it's important to continue this and develop a routine, as the birds will become reliant upon your help. Put out feed at the beginning of the day to ensure the wild birds can replace the energy that they have lost over night. It's best to have multiple feeding sites within the garden to prevent overcrowding. Moving them around regularly will prevent a build-up of droppings. <br>

                                        Peckish squirrel proof bird food suet pellets are high in energy with added hot pepper flavour. Tasty for wild birds but helps deter squirrels. Adding the chilli pepper means that the suet pellets are too hot for squirrels to eat and helps stop them pinching the food. The wild birds in your garden still love them, making them an ideal high energy food.

                                        Beaphar CARE+ Junior Rabbit is a very tasty, super premium complete feed. Each pack of CARE+ provides all the goodness your rabbit needs and the ‘all-in-one’ pellet ensures there is no preferential food selection, as each pellet has the same composition, therefore no leftovers in the bowl. The hardened pellets support the natural wearing of the teeth and the small size of the pellets are ideally suited for young rabbits. Beaphar CARE+ Junior Rabbit contains vitamin E for the body cells, a suitable crude fibre content, vitamin A and calcium to aid in development together with aromatic herbs. Beaphar CARE+ Junior Rabbit is a perfectly balanced feed for young rabbits up to 10 months age and is recommended for pregnant and nursing rabbits. <br>
                                        <br>Rabbits aged 3-6 weeks should have the opportunity to eat small quantities Care + Junior Rabbit and hay in addition to their mother’s milk. Between 6-10 weeks of age, they should be weaned onto solid food. During the first week after bringing your new rabbit home with you, feed the same food that the breeder or shop was feeding. During the second and third week, gradually change the food to CARE+ Junior Rabbit by mixing the two together. During its first 6 months, your rabbit can eat as much CARE+ as it wants. From about 6 months, the average rabbit will need about 35g of food per kg body weight per day, which is preferably split into 2 meals. At 9 -10 months of age, gradually change to CARE+ Rabbit for adult rabbits. <br>
                                        <br>For pregnant and nursing rabbits, unlimited access to CARE+ Junior Rabbit is recommended. 

                                        Fresh drinking water and hay should be provided at all times.<br>

                                        Especially formulated for older rabbits, the pellets are low in calcium to prevent kidney and bladder problems. Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Green Tea Extract and Ginseng are added, which are important antioxidants that contribute to the rabbit’s natural defenses. A low protein content and no added sugars help to prevent obesity in less active older rabbits. Also contains an extra high crude fibre content for digestive health.

                                        Burgess Excel Rat Nuggets are an all-in-one meal created especially for your pet rats’ needs as omnivores. Each delicious nugget contains the perfect combination of vitamins, minerals and nutrients. <br>

                                        <br> The nuggets prevent selective feeding – unlike muesli-style foods where rats often pick out sweet bits and leave the rest, leading to an imbalanced diet. Burgess Excel Rat Nuggets provide a tasty, balanced, healthy diet with added minerals to help maintain beautiful coat colour and prebiotics to encourage friendly bacteria for a healthy digestion.Linseed is added to help maintain a healthy coat. <br>

                                        <br> The nugget size has been specifically set to promote the natural gnawing behaviour that is so vital for rats’ dental and emotional health.
